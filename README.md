# Piano Learning Helpers

This repository contains graphical helpers designed to assist with learning piano chords, scales, and chord progressions. These documents can be printed and placed behind the piano keys to visually guide you on where to place your fingers. They work fine with my Roland FP30X and should also fit other keyboards and classical pianos. 

## Features

- **Chords:** Visual guides for major, minor, and various other chord types.
- **Scales:** Finger placement for major, minor, and other scales.
- **Progressions:** Visual aids for common chord progressions.
